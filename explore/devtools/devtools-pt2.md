Q1) num1 and num2 contain strings and so result is concactanating them together to form a string.

Q2) On line 11 when we add the two strings to result, we should call parseInt on num1 and parseInt on num2 and then add both of them together. parseInt converts a string to an integer therefore we will achieve what the problem wanted to which is to add 2 integers instead of 2 strings.
