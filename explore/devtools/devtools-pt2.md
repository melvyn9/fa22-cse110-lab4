Q1) num1 and num2 contain strings and so result is concactanating them together to form a string.

Q2) On line 11 when we add the two strings to result, we should call parseFloat on num1 and parseFloat on num2 and then add both of them together. parseFloat converts a string to its float value therefore we will achieve what the problem wanted to which is to add 2 numbers instead of 2 strings. I choose parseFloat instead of parseInt because parseInt is for integers and calling parseInt on '3.5' will return the integer 3.5 and not take into account decimals.
